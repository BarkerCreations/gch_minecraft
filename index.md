# Welcome to Glasgow Children Hospital Minecraft
## Introduction

This project was initiated by Ginkgo Projects and funded by Trefoil House. Production and management was handled by Hadi Mehrpouya of Abertay University and Chris Barker.

The work conducted here was informed by a feasibility study written in 2016 which investigated what might be an effective and useful way to collaborate with Hospital patients to make an interactive digital version of the buildings.

## Team

The project was lead and coordinated by Hadi Mehrpouya and Chris Barker, as stated in the Introduction.

Students from Abertay University were enlisted to increase the frequency with which the workshops in the hospital could be conducted. The two people selected were Nikita Kotter and Bettina Georgieva, both of whom being students under Hadi Mehrpouya.

Later in the project Edinburgh artist Robert Powell was brought in to assist in the production of a promotional video.

## Map preparation
Prior to the workshop phase some basic structure was produced on the PC version of minecraft by HM and CB. This process involved using reference photos and satellite imagery to assess the shape and scale of the childrenâ€™s hospital. Foundations were then drawn out onto a blank Minecraft map at an approximate scale of 1 block = 0.5 metres.

The aim of this phase was to avoid having the patients spend too much time considering architectural minutia and instead to have them creating sections of the model from what they had seen or what they could imagine an improved version of the building to be like.

## Production Phase
Production consisted of numerous visits in person to the hospital to conduct workshops. Each session was approximately 2.5 hrs, divided between typically 2-3 patients. Workshop facilitators would collaborate with the patient to produce a small part of the hospital map. This might be a room (particularly their own) or a large piece of furnishing like a pond or play area. The focus of the workshops was always to have them lead creatively by the patient. The facilitator was in place to assist where needed and to suggest what Minecraft blocks might work best to realise the ambitions of the patient.

Following a visit the map file was backed up and shared with the project team via Dropbox. Where possible a facilitator would spend the remainder of their day cleaning-up or making improvements to the part of the hospital that had been built in their workshop. Screenshots and camera photos of the screen during play were shared similarly.

## Consolidation
Between the main run of workshops and the distribution of the map to the hospital consoles, some time was invested in filling any gaps in the overall structure of the hospital building model. Particularly this was in making sure that all floors extended through most of the model and that there was roofing and internal lighting through the majority of the footprint.
